        <section id="p5" class="section-box">
            <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
            <p>It's fun to read, and it's easy to interact with the text with animations.</p>
        </section>

        <br>

        <section id="p6" class="section-box">
            <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
            <p>The large font title text directly shows the content of the page, and the simple box shadow effect on hover drives the user's interaction with the text.</p>
        </section>

        <br>

        <section id="p7" class="section-box">
            <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
            <p>With a total of 7 times about 30 minutes to interact with the animation and audio rhythm played on the webpage, I feel that using the internet as both medium and material requires a sustained attention to read through and the need to refresh the page to play with possibility. Like trying to compose new poetry sentences by pausing the animation on the green columns.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="p8" class="section-box">
            <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
            <p>Green boxes can play word-changing animations at the same time, and each box plays with the rhythm of the text, both of which guide users to play with duration, mutation, and possibility.</p>
        </section>

        <br>

        <section id="p9" class="section-box">
            <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
            <p>The changing words in the green box are displayed like a word card style. Also, the poems appear in extended columns, as if referring to ancient scrolls.</p>
        </section>

        <br>

        <section id="p10" class="section-box">
            <h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
            <p>Since the ancient scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, the similarly shaped columns seem to indicate that users can click to access the content of the poem.</p>
        </section>

        <br>

        <section id="p11" class="section-box">
            <h3>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
            <p>Excited and nervous as if seven secret documents were about to be revealed, and eager to continue exploring.</p>
        </section>

        <br>

        <section id="p12" class="section-box">
            <h3>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
            <p>I had to constantly focus on word changes and wasted some time watching repetitive animated text in order to read the entire poem. Due to the lack of a back button, there is no way to quickly confirm a missed word unless the full animation is shown again after the entire poem has been played once.</p>
        </section>

        <br>

        <section id="p13" class="section-box">
            <h3>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
            <p>The most satisfying part is the sound design that pops up along with the animation. 
                Achieve seven types of audio cues by altering the pitch of the same sample, drawing the eye while setting the theme. Since the audio cues follow the rhythm of the word animation, the user's actions feel more predictable and enjoyable.</p>
